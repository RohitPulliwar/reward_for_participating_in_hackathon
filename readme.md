# Hackathon Rewarding System

## Project Title
Rewarding for Participating in Hackathons

## Project Description
The **Rewarding for Participating in Hackathons** system is a decentralized application built on the Ethereum blockchain using Solidity. It allows participants to register for hackathons, submit projects, and get rewarded based on their project score. Hackathon creators (admins) can create hackathons, set reward pools, evaluate project submissions, and distribute rewards accordingly.

Participants can join hackathons, submit their projects, and compete for rewards. The reward pool is allocated to participants based on the score of their project after it's evaluated. This system ensures a transparent and decentralized rewarding mechanism where the rewards are directly tied to project performance.

## Project Vision
The vision behind this project is to create a fair and transparent reward distribution system for hackathons in the blockchain space. This system removes intermediaries and ensures that participants are rewarded directly based on their performance in the hackathons, using decentralized technology for trust and security.

## Key Features

1. **Hackathon Creation**:
   - Hackathons can be created by admins, setting the theme, reward pool, and time frame for participation.
   
2. **Project Submission**:
   - Participants can submit their projects to hackathons, providing details such as the project title and description.

3. **Project Evaluation**:
   - Judges evaluate the submitted projects and assign scores to each project.
   - Only evaluated projects are eligible for rewards.

4. **Reward Distribution**:
   - After all projects are evaluated, the total score is used to distribute rewards fairly among all participants.
   - The reward pool is divided according to the proportion of each project’s score to the total score.

5. **Reward Withdrawal**:
   - Participants can withdraw their rewards in Ether once the hackathon ends and rewards are distributed.

6. **Hackathon Funding**:
   - Admins can fund the hackathon’s reward pool with Ether, which will be distributed to participants after scoring.

### Future Improvements
- Adding more complex reward systems like badges and levels.
- Integrating a UI to make it easier for users to interact with the system.
- Implementing multi-judge functionality for fairer evaluations.
